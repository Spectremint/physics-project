# 2022 Conceptual Physics Project
Read below for some information on the game or just click one of these two links below to jump in.

There are *two* control schemes:<br>
**- Use the ARROW KEYS to move and SPACE to select.**<br>
**- Use the mouse (or your touch) to click on a tile to move to and click on things to interact with them.**<br>

If you feel like the default speed is too slow, press Escape at any time and enter the Options menu; from there, turn on **"Always Dash"**.

# About this Project
This is a small game I wrote in RPG Maker MV. In short, it's a tool designed for writing role-playing games using a robust GUI and JavaScript plugins.<br>
Many games, both on home computers and video game consoles, have been written in this engine... it's very, very capable.<br>
This game acts both as a demonstration of what a simple project made in MV looks like, and as a sort of warm-up for me getting used to writing games in this engine.

You play as none other than myself. I go through a short, fictionalized version of the process of me creating the document linked above and explained in game, complete with my own sense of confusion. There's some secrets and fun little lines of dialogue that I wrote to make the whole thing feel a little more polished and fun, so once you've beaten the game once you're free to poke around as much as you want in these 2D-rendered versions of the various hallways.

# Technical Notes

The game should run fine under **Chrome or Firefox** on: <br>
**- Windows** <br>
**- MacOS**<br>
**- Linux/ChromeOS (Chromebooks)**<br>
**- Android/iOS (including touch controls!)**<br>
Additionally, it should also work under **Safari for MacOS and iOS.**

*Long loading times are normal.* This is because of the limitations of the engine's web implementation; it has to load assets from the fileserver (located in the repository at /main/www/). I did it this way to make sure that *everyone* in class could run it without having to download an executable to their computer.

Due to time constraints and perhaps a lack of knowledge about the engine, *some very, very minor things may be broken.* 

Older builds had real life names for me and my teacher. These are gone, thanks to the repository being public.

Every asset used here comes stock with the engine itself. The tileset in question is known internally as *SF_Inside*, with various floor patterns, walls and objects in the room meant to look like a science lab (rather fitting), but it worked well enough here to use it as the tileset for a school area.

If you like this project and want to play with the engine, you can get it on Valve Software's *Steam* platform, usually for about $15 USD when it goes on sale.<br>
Alternatively, a 30-day free trial is available [on the official website](https://www.rpgmakerweb.com/free-trials) if you're unsure about your skills.
Older versions of the software (such as RPG Maker 2003 and RPG Maker XP) can also be purchased on Steam for cheaper on sale, around $3-5 USD.
