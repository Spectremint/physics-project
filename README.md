# physics-project.github.io
A small game I created in Degica Games' RPG Maker MV, meant as a form of presentation used for my Unit Project for Unit 1 of my Physics class. This website hosts the game itself (in .html form) and a PDF containing the table and notes I made for the project.

Names of real people were originally included, but I have removed them for the sake of privacy; I don't have GitHub's premium subscription so I can't make a public page with a private repository.

All assets used in-game are from the engine's built-in RTP; all asset rights go to KADOKAWA CORPORATION / Degica Games.
